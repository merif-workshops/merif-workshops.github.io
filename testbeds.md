The Workshop will begin with short presentations that describe the testbeds including their targeted scientific areas. This will be followed by 3-hour hands-on tutorials by each of the testbeds, three during May 29, afternoon and three during May 30 morning. 

The following briefly describes each testbed. See the URLs given for detailed information.

## Chameleon
  - [chameleoncloud.org](http://www.chameleoncloud.org)

The Chameleon project provides a large-scale, fully configurable experimental testbed driven by the needs of the cloud research and education communities. The testbed, and the ecosystem associated with it, will enable researchers to explore a range of cloud research challenges, from large scale to small scale, including exploring low-level problems in hardware architecture, systems research, network configuration, and software design, or at higher levels of abstraction looking at cloud scheduling, cloud platforms, and cloud applications. 

## CloudLab
  - [cloudlab.us](http://www.cloudlab.us)

CloudLab will be a place where researchers can try out ideas using any cloud software stack they can imagine. It will accomplish this by running at a layer below cloud infrastructure: it will provide isolated, bare-metal access to a set of resources that researchers can use to bring up their own clouds. These clouds may run instances of today's popular stacks, modest modifications to them, or something entirely new. CloudLab will not be tied to any particular particular cloud stack, and will support experimentation on multiple in parallel. 

## COSMOS
  - [cosmos-lab.org](https://www.cosmos-lab.org/)

The Cloud Enhanced Open Software Defined Mobile Wireless Testbed for City-Scale Deployment (COSMOS) supports at-scale experimentation of novel advanced wireless broadband and communication technologies in the sub-6 GHz bands and in the millimeter wave frequency bands in a densely populated, urban setting. Radio nodes in COSMOS provide a mix of fully programmable software defined radios (SDRs) for flexible wireless experimentation as well as commercial hardware capable of supporting networking and applications research with currently available end-user devices. The design includes novel 100 Gbps+ fiber, free space optical, and microwave backhaul technologies interconnected with a software-defined network (SDN) switching fabric for minimum latency and flexibility in setting up experimental network topologies.

## ORBIT
  - [orbit-lab.org/](http://www.orbit-lab.org/)

The ORBIT testbed, which researchers access remotely over the Internet, provides a flexible, scalable and reproducible platform for conducting wireless network experiments. ORBIT lowers the barrier for experimentation in the area of radio and wireless technology and thus improves education and research productivity in the field. 

## Edge-Net
  - [Edge-Net.org](http://Edge-Net.org)

EdgeNet is a viral, distributed edge cloud, in the family of PlanetLab, GENI, JGN-X, and PlanetLab Europe. It is a modern distributed edge cloud, incorporating advances in Cloud technologies over the past few years. EdgeNet is based on industry-standard Cloud software, with Docker as the containerization technology and Kubernetes as the node manager and deployment solution. It is an opt-in global Kubernetes cluster; once a user has authenticated with this portal and been approved, she will be able to use standard Kubernetes tools and technologies to deploy an application across the EdgeNet infrastructure.

## GENI
  - [geni.net](http://www.geni.net)

The Global Environment for Network Innovations (GENI) is a large-scale, experimental facility to support the experimental exploration of robust new networking , distributed systems, and service architectures. GENI is a comprehensive, continental-scale research facility that allows controlled end-to-end experimentation with new architectures, protocols, services, data dissemination techniques, and more, running over an extensive national fiber optic infrastructure with next generation dynamic optical switching and routing, fully programmable core and edge nodes, heterogeneous sensor networks, wireless networks and other edge devices. All infrastructure is shared among a large number of individual, simultaneous experiments and is instrumented for the collection, analysis and pooling of measurements.


## POWDER-RENEW
  - [powderwireless.net](http://powderwireless.net)

The Platform for Open Wireless Data-driven Experimental Research (POWDER) supports at-scale experimentation of novel advanced wireless broadband and communication technologies in the sub-6 GHz band. The project features interactions with regional networks encompassing initiatives on public transportation, broadband delivery, education and health service delivery as well as advancement of science, technology and research by creating an ecosystem of a hundred small companies in allied technical domains. A key feature of the platform is the partnership with the Reconfigurable Eco-system for Next-generation End-to-end Wireless (RENEW) project at Rice University to develop a highly programmable and flexible massive multi-input multi-output (MIMO) platform that is an essential feature of both 5G and beyond-5G wireless networks.
